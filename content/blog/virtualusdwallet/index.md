## Introduction

By now you have probably heard about 'bitcoin' and despite its many advantages over other forms of assets and money everyone agrees that bitcoin is highly volatile. 

>But, what if you could use bitcoin without being affected by its volatility?? 

This series of posts show you how to have a US dollar wallet without opening a US dollar account with your bank or physical dollar notes. This USD wallet is backed by bitcoin, through a stablecoin called Tether(USDT). It alllows you to virtually move between your local currency and the USD with the least loss(slippage). 

The closest alternative is using online banking to buy USD bank you require to hold both KSH and USD at the same bank to do this, or visit a Forex Bureau and use physical notes. 

>The same technology can be applied to buying gold (XAUT)

Bitcoin is used in the middle between your local currency USD. See flowchart below:

## Why you need a USD Wallet

During global uncertainity like the current COVID19 pandemic in 2020, it is a good idea to diversify your cash savings in USD, gold or bitcoin just incase your local currency loses value against the dollar.

The chart below shows the performance of the USD against the Kenya shilling since 2002. It is clear that the shilling has been losing its value against the dollar for the last 30 years. Open chart below and observe how it happened during the 2008 financial crisis and the shillign has never gone back to the 60s level ever.
> Fyi: During president's Kibaki first term in 2002, he managed to strengthen the shilling from 80s to 60s !!

During the last global financial crisis in 2008, you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) the shilling lost 30% of its value in a span of two years (from 62 to 81).

Macroeconomics is a wide area of study with many things to consider ; Federal Reserve and Central Banks actions,  interest rates, treasury bonds yields, stock markets, oil, gold, unemployment rates etc.

However, what is clear to everyone observing the current situation is that both local and global productivity has been slowing down, several businesses have shutdown, some people have lost jobs, or experienced paycuts, rent defaults, debt defaults etc. 

It is difficult to predict when the pandemic will be over and things get back to normal, or how bad the economy will be affected, especially in developing countries which might face longer lockdowns.

Hence the need to spread your risk among assets that may hold their value more strongly, are **100% online** and have enough liquidity to get in and out. In my opinion that is; USD, gold and bitcoin.



### How the 'bitcoin-backed' USD wallet works

While there are several ways of having a bitcoin-backed USD wallet, this guide will use **Tether (USDT)**:

- You buy bitcoin, then use the bitcoin to buy tether. 
- [Tether](https://tether.to/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=353ac175af32529c8a92bc392f6a83ba906a0fc8-1585642069-0-AYxII_WswTRtQwiOW0UMtQqwaZnvS2KHCMDqqB5M_zgyUtQRW9UjmLafMEW1666Gr5hs7o_MmejJDCUCzq0CPJWZ3ZEJpo_dbxY0No6Q8Le379uSvm01AAHHhBnDo7mGQs2vTqvoCAZEwnbnouG6rfHb6plGg5o6cJA0zSUY3kcGptnUA2kE2IFtoH5fWLFYxr-eJsn7LoHlWVc9I7Mwg8uUAe8kOvSNR9lV2FQ4CRzZojmcSAhNtw8jChWFW_lVD8aw0AZ86DTE6g4TwBXwIuQ) is a cryptocurrency whose value is equal to the value of USD. Hence **1 Tether = 1 USD** thus 100 USDT can be redeemed for 100 USD and so forth
- When you want to cash out some USD to your local currency, you sell the equivalent tether/USDT to bitcoin, then sell the bitcoin back to your local currency. 
- Every country has independent traders who buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for local currency 24/7, so bitcoin -> local currency liquidity is guranteed




### Alternative methods of buying USD

- Visit a Forex Bureau and exchange your local currency for USD. During the current pandemic, it is not advisable to handle cash. So this method puts your health at risk
- If you hold a local currency and USD account at your bank, call or visit your nearest branch and initiate the forex transfer. If you have activate online banking for both accounts then you can do the transaction from home
- Visit your bank and open a USD account, also remember to activate online banking service for both of your accounts. Again, its not the best time to be visiting banking halls due to the current pandemic. 
- As the lockdown continues, most forex bureaus and banks branches will close and offer services through ATM/mobile banking/internet banking services
- The **KEY ADVANTAGE** of a bitcoin-backed USD wallet is now eviedent since it is entirely virtual, minimum KYC is required and th market operates 24/7 


### End to end process of moving from local currency (KSH) to bitcoin, to USD and back to local currency(KSH)

I have broken down the process into 9 different posts. Post 1, 2 and 7 are done only once during initial setup. Then the rest are done at different times based on what you want to achieve, but are dependent on some things to have been done earlier, for example; _you can't buy tether(USDT) without having bitcoin or ethereum in the first place_ hence the the posts are numbered in the following order of operations:


1.  Sign up for a localbitcoins account [click here](/signup-lbc)
2.  Sign up for a binance account [click here](/signup-binance)
3.  Buying bitcoins from localbitcoins [click here](/buy-bitcoin-lbc)
