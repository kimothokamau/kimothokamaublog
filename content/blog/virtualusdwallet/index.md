By now you have probably heard about 'bitcoin' and despite its many advantages over other forms of assets and money everyone agrees that bitcoin is highly volatile. This guide shows how its possible to use bitcoin to hold USD stable value such that you don't get affected by volatility.
Among its many usecases is the fact that it can be used to have exposure to USD without having to actually own USD (physical notes or a USD bank account). This basically means that it is the fastest way to ensure your savings retain their USD value.

## Why you may need a USD Wallet
The idea is that during uncertain times like this (COVID19), it may be wise to save a portion of your cash savings in USD since most currencies are dropping in value compared to the USD.
The chart below shows the performance of the USD against the Kenya shilling since 2002. It's a clear uptrend, meaning it has always been profitable to store you savings in USD. 
Observe how the USD rose by 30% during the 2008 financial crisis. By looking at metrics liek unemployment numbers, forced lockdowns, strain on healthcare etc, COVID19 appears to be a bigger crisis than the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) and most assets including currencies decrease in price compared to the USD. This is my personal opinion and I may be completely wrong.

### How the 'bitcoin-backed' USD wallet works

While there are several ways of having a bitcoin-backed USD wallet, this guide will use Tether (USDT):

- You buy bitcoin, then use the bitcoin to buy tether. 
- [Tether](https://tether.to/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=353ac175af32529c8a92bc392f6a83ba906a0fc8-1585642069-0-AYxII_WswTRtQwiOW0UMtQqwaZnvS2KHCMDqqB5M_zgyUtQRW9UjmLafMEW1666Gr5hs7o_MmejJDCUCzq0CPJWZ3ZEJpo_dbxY0No6Q8Le379uSvm01AAHHhBnDo7mGQs2vTqvoCAZEwnbnouG6rfHb6plGg5o6cJA0zSUY3kcGptnUA2kE2IFtoH5fWLFYxr-eJsn7LoHlWVc9I7Mwg8uUAe8kOvSNR9lV2FQ4CRzZojmcSAhNtw8jChWFW_lVD8aw0AZ86DTE6g4TwBXwIuQ) is a cryptocurrency that mirrors the value of USD. Hence **1 Tether = 1 USD** thus 100 USDT can be redeemed for 100 USD and so forth
- When you want to cash out some USD to your local currency, sell the equivalent tether/USDT to bitcoin, then sell the bitcoin back to your local currency. 
- Every country has independent traders who buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for local currency 24/7, so bitcoin-local currency liquidity is guranteed


### Alternative methods of buying USD

- Visit a Forex Bureau and exchange your local currency for USD. During the current pandemic, it is not advisable to handle cash. So this method puts your health at risk
- If you hold a local currency and USD account at your bank, call or visit your nearest branch and initiate the forex transfer. If you have activate online banking for both accounts then you can do the transaction from home
- Visit your bank and open a USD account, also remember to activate online banking service for both of your accounts. Again, its not the best time to be visiting banking halls due to the current pandemic. 
- As the lockdown continues, most forex bureaus and banks branches will close and offer services through ATM/mobile banking/internet banking services
- The **KEY ADVANTAGE** of a bitcoin-backed USD wallet is now eviedent since it is entirely virtual, minimum KYC is required and th market operates 24/7 


## Enough background, lets start...
I have broken down the process into 6 different posts since they are independent activities that you can do separately in other scenarios:

1.  Sign up for a localbitcoins account
2.  Sign up for a binance account
3.  Buying bitcoins from localbitcoins
4.  Sending bitcoins from localbitcoins to your binance wallet
5.  Use the bitcoins deposited to binance to buy Tether/USDT
6.  The reverse// sell tether/USDT to bitcoin, then send the bitcoin to localbitcoins and sell to local currency
