title: A Virtual USD Wallet-Backed by Bitcoin
date: "2020-04-06T22:40:32.169Z"
description: A guide on how to have a US dollar wallet without opening a US dollar account with your bank or physical dollar notes. This USD wallet is backed by bitcoin, through a stablecoin called Tether. For the rest of these guides, I will refer to this stablecoin as Tether(USDT). Bitcoin allows you to virtually move between your local currency and the USD with the least loss(spread). Alternatives for this is buying USD at your bank, you require to hold both KSH and USD at the same bank to do this, or visit a Forex Bureau and use physical notes. The same technology can be applied to holding other assets like gold through online-only transactions.

## Introduction

A virtual USD wallet enables you to store US dollars in an online-wallet that you can access 24/7, and it also allows you to convert a part or all of your US dollars to your local currency anytime.

Historically, most local currencies especially in developing countries have been losing their value to the US dollar. 
>For example, if you had Ksh. 100,000 in the year 2000 you could have bought $1408 dollars at the USDKES rate of 71. 

>If you saved the dollars till now and decided to convert back to KSH, you would get Ksh. 150,000 at the current USDKES rate of 106.5. 

>If however you saved in KSH and wanted to buy dollars now, you would only get (100,000/106.5) 938 dollars.

Chart below shows how the USD has been outperforming the shilling since 1998.

### Why the US dollar is preferred to local currency

The main reason why the US dollar is the preferred currency to hold long-term is because it is the world's [reserve currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency). It got this status during the [Bretton Woods conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system) in 1945, replacing the British Pound. The US dollar was backed with gold. Meaning you could take dollars to a bank and get gold in return.

How is a global reserve currency used:
- Countries borrowing and repaying debt to other countries  
- Commercial banks hold USD to facilitate international transfers, e.g when you make a wire transfer to a different country, even if the receiver is using a different currency, the intermediary banks use USD to settle between them 
- Central Banks hold large amounts of USD to payinternational debts and to influence the domestic exchange rate 
- Oil trades are settled in USD etc

The current global pandemic (COVID19) makes it even more important to hold a part of your wealth in USD rather than local currency.

> Other safe havens to hold your wealth in are gold and bitcoin, they are discussed in my other articles [click here](/buy-gold-xaut) to know how you can buy gold, [click here](/bitcoin-introduction) to know more about bitcoin

### How the 'bitcoin-backed' USD wallet works

- You buy bitcoin using your local currency, immediately send the bitcoin to a cryptocurrency exchange called binance and buy tether(USDT) using the bitcoin. You now have USD
- [Tether](https://tether.to/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=353ac175af32529c8a92bc392f6a83ba906a0fc8-1585642069-0-AYxII_WswTRtQwiOW0UMtQqwaZnvS2KHCMDqqB5M_zgyUtQRW9UjmLafMEW1666Gr5hs7o_MmejJDCUCzq0CPJWZ3ZEJpo_dbxY0No6Q8Le379uSvm01AAHHhBnDo7mGQs2vTqvoCAZEwnbnouG6rfHb6plGg5o6cJA0zSUY3kcGptnUA2kE2IFtoH5fWLFYxr-eJsn7LoHlWVc9I7Mwg8uUAe8kOvSNR9lV2FQ4CRzZojmcSAhNtw8jChWFW_lVD8aw0AZ86DTE6g4TwBXwIuQ) is a cryptocurrency whose value is equal to the value of USD. Hence **1 Tether = 1 USD** thus 100 USDT can be redeemed for 100 USD and so forth
- When you want to cash out some USD to your local currency, you sell the equivalent tether to bitcoin, then sell the bitcoin back to your local currency
- Bitcoin is used in the middle between your local currency USD. See flowchart below:

## Comparison of bitcoin backed USD wallet vs Forex vs Banks

Apart from having your wealth in USD by using the 'bitcoin-backed' virtual wallet, you can achieve the same by purchasing US dollars in a commercial bank or a Foreign Exchange Bureau.

I would like to compare these 3 methods using 3 key factors:

+ Cost
+ Process
+ Availability/convenience


### Cost -Rates/Spread

The difference between the selling price and buying price of USDKES. The lower it is the better. Lower spread means there is less volatility since there is enough willing buyers and sellers competing away till the [spread](/virtualusdwallet/#Cost--RatesSpread) becomes thin.

   + **Banks:** 
        + Very high. On April 3rd 2020, one of the local banks was selling the dollar at 109, while buying at 99. That is a 99/109 * 100 = **10.10%**
        + If you buy dollars at a bank today, if you want to sell them the next day, you will make a 10% loss of your money. For you to sell the dollars at a profit you would have to wait for the shilling to increase considerably for you to just break even
        + The non $100 notes are shunned and are bought below market rate
   + **Forex**
        + High. On April 3rd 2020, one local forex bureau was selling dollar at 107, while buying at 100. That is a 7/100 * 100 = **7%**
        + If you bought dollars at a forex bureau today, if you want to sell them the next day, you will make a 7% loss on your money. The dollar needs to rise by more than 7% for you to breakeven.
        + The non $100 notes are shunned and are bought below market rate
   + **Bitcoin**
        + Low. On April 3rd 2020, the cheapest bitcoin seller was selling at a rate of ksh. 764,000 per bitcoin while the highest buyer was buying at 752,000. Spread was (764000-752000) /752000 * 100 = **1.6%** 

### Process of getting dollar exposure and getting back to KSH

This criteria looks at the steps it takes to get dollar exposure and back to KSH  
+ **Banks:**
    +  Open USD and KSH accounts in a bank, activate online banking for both of them. Do forex between the two accounts
    +  Withdraw ksh in one bank account, and buy USD Over the Counter(OTC) at same bank, or walk in different bank (may be with lower USDKSH rate) and buy there Over The Counter
+ **Forex:**
    +  Walk in with local currency cash and buy physical dollars
    +  Require national ID or passport

- **Bitcoin:**
    +  Open accounts at bitcoin exchanges
    +  Buy bitcoin ,tether(USDT) using exchange interface
    +  Online transactions


### Availability

A measure of convenience:

+ **Banks:**
    +  Online banking works 24/7. But you will use the provided rate which has 9-11% spread
    +  If you want a better rate it has to be within working hours so that you speak to a treasury bank staff to negotiate a better rate
    +  Other option is to walk in the banking hall within working hours

+ **Forex**
    + The least convenient. Most work within working hours
    + Cash only
    + No online option. You need to be there
    + They have not yet solved the virtual/wallet/online problem yet

+ **Bitcoin**
    + The most convenient
    + Available 24/7 and 100% online
    + No physical cash trades
    + 24/7 access to USD wallet that you can liquidate any time
    + Since wallets are online, it can work on any phone, or computer device

        

### End to end process of moving from local currency (KSH) to bitcoin, to USD and back to local currency(KSH)

I have broken down this [process](/ Open accounts at bitcoin exchanges
        +  Buy bitcoin ,tether(USDT) using exchange interface
        +  Online transactions) into 9 different posts. 
        
Post 1, 2 and 7 are done only once during initial setup. 

Then the rest are done at different times based on what you want to achieve, but are dependent on some things to have been done earlier, for example; _you can't buy tether(USDT) without having bitcoin or ethereum in the first place_
