### What is bitcoin

Bitcoin is a digital asset/property that does the following:
- Savings tool: it has fixed total supply (21 million) 
- The absolute scarcity makes it attractive asset for long term investors to hold
- Payment: Bitcoin clears and settles globally within 30-60 minutes. It does micro-payments and even large transactions. Traditional systems

### The investment case for bitcoin

If you have these questions:
 -  Should I invest in bitcoin?
 -  Why does bitcoin has value? 
 -  Why has bitcoin's price increased from $0 to $7000 as of today (April 6th)
 -  Why will it keep increasing in value for the next forseable future?
 -  What is money? And what stages does money go through before it finally gets adopted by everyone?
 -  The properties that make bitcoin the best money ever in history

 These two articles cover those questions:

### Bitcoin's value modelled against scarcity

This is a model that predicts the price of bitcoin using scarcity, scarcity is measured by measuring the ration of new supply to the existing supply.

When bitcoin started in 2009, 7200 bitcoins were being mined everyday, from 2012 this number halved to 3600, then in 2016 it halved to 1800 a day. In May 2020 it will reduce again to 900. 

The new supply will continue halving until 2140....

> In 2136, 0.00000168 BTC will be mined per day

In this article , PLan B, models bitcoin's scarcity and compares it to other precious metals like gold and silver which have known supplies.

### The complete Satoshi

To read Satoshi's first announcement of bitcoin in a cryptography mailing list,the bitcoin whitepaper, see the first critics and how Satoshi responded to their questions firsthand in the early days of bitcoin. [The Complete Satoshi](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/)

A compilation of pre-bitcoin literature that supports the idea of bitcoin from a cryptography and freedom point of view [click here](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/literature/)

A compilation of post-bitcoin articles that were written from 2012. They are highly vetted and new articles go through rigorous peer-reveiw before they are allowed here. [click here](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool) Note the pun :) Mempool is what we call the bunch of transactions that are waiting to be mined.

>It took me months to go through all of this section, and by the time I finished I realized that the idea of bitcoin was worth exploring.


### History of bitcoin

Bitcoin did not just come from nowhere. See the motivations behind it and the efforts that were done from the 1970s till its inception.

For example the cypherpunks and cryptoanarchy communities where bitcoin cam from. [histoy of bitcoin](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/history.html)


### The technical side of bitcoin

Bitcoin code is + 30000 lines of C++ code, the code is open source on github and you can access it, view it, fork it and even make a pull request for your contribution to be evaluated and merged into the bitcoin protocol if it is deemed very important.

If you are technically curious about how bitcoin works under the hood, want to make APIs, or applications that interact with the bitcoin protocol, this article by Pierre Rochard is a good place to start [click here](https://medium.com/@pierre_rochard/understanding-the-technical-side-of-bitcoin-2c212dd65c09)
