## Introduction

The question of what is bitcoin has been answered before and by more prolific writers. My idea is that rather than re-inventing the wheel, I can just point you to the best resources that answer this question.


### Tell me EVERYTHING!!

This [link](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html) takes you to a compilation of everything you may want to know in the bitcoin space.It can be overwhelming, but just start somewhere you think intersts you. 

There is various sections, some for scholars, investors, software developers, techincal information, miners, traders, analysts looking for data, blockchain...etc etc


### The investment case for bitcoin


If you have these questions:
 -  Should I invest in bitcoin?
 -  Why bitcoin has value? 
 -  Why its value has increased from $0 to $7000 as of today (April 6th) *Implement a fetch to query real-time price API**
 -  Why it will keep increasing in value for the next forseable future?
 -  What is money? And what stages does money go through before it finally gets dopted by everyone?
 -  The properties of bitcoin that makes it the best money ever in history 

 These two articles cover all your questions:

### Best of the Best: The compltete Satoshi

To read Satoshi's first announcement of bitcoin in a cryptography mailing list/forum, read thw whitepaper, see the first critics and how he graciously responded to their questions. [The Complete Satoshi](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/)

A compilation of literature that supports the idea of bitcoin from a cryptography and freedome point of view [click here](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/literature/)

A compilation of articles that were written from 2012. They are highly vetted and new articles go through rigorous brainstorming before they are allowed here. [click here](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool)

>It took me almost two months to go through all of this section, and by the time I finished I realized that the idea of bitcoin resonated with my inner self, and that it would make the life of every person better when it replaces our current monetary system. I got a strong conviction to leave my telecoms career and focus my efforts on building the bitcoin infrastrucuture and educating the people around me. 

### History of bitcoin

Bitcoin did not just come from nowhere. See the motivations behind it and the efforts that were done from the 1970s till its inception.

### The technical side of bitcoin

If you are a programmer, then this section is perfect for you. At the core, bitcoin code is + 30000 lines of C++ code, the code is open source on github and you can access it, view it and even make a pull request to contribute your code.

If you are curious about how bitcoin works under the hood, or would want to make APIs, or applications that interact with the bitcoin protocol, this article by Pierre Rochard is a good place to start [click here](https://medium.com/@pierre_rochard/understanding-the-technical-side-of-bitcoin-2c212dd65c09)


### Still under construction !!!
