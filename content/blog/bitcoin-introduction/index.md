### What is bitcoin

Bitcoin is a product that combines aspects from different fields; mathematics, distributed systems, publick key infrastructure, cryptography, economics, game-theory & consensus in peer-to-peer networks, anthropology and history. And this is why it is mostly misunderstood.

### The complete Satoshi

To read Satoshi's first announcement of bitcoin in a cryptography mailing list,the bitcoin whitepaper, see the first critics and how Satoshi responded to their questions firsthand in the early days of bitcoin. [The Complete Satoshi](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/)

A compilation of pre-bitcoin literature that supports the idea of bitcoin from a cryptography and freedom point of view [click here](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/literature/)

A compilation of post-bitcoin articles that were written from 2012. They are highly vetted and new articles go through rigorous peer-reveiw before they are allowed here.
