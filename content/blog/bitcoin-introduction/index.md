## Introduction

The question of what is bitcoin has been answered before and by more prolific writers. My idea is that rather than re-inventing the wheel, I can just point you to the best resources that answer this question.

### Tell me EVERYTHING!!

This [link](/https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html) takes you to a compilation of everything you may want to know in the bitcoin space.It can be overwhelming, but just start somewhere you think intersts you. 

There is various sections, some for scholars, investors, software developers, techincal information, miners, traders, analysts looking for data, blockchain...etc etc

Answer these questions:
 -  Why bitcoin has value? 
 -  Why its value has increased from 0 to $7000 as of today (April 6th) *Implement a fetch to query real-time price**
 -  Why will it keep increasing for the next forseable future?
 -  What is money? And what stages does money go through before it finally gets dopted by everyone?
 -  The properties of bitcoin that makes it the best money ever in history 

### Best of the Best: The compltete Satoshi

To read Satoshi's first announcement of bitcoin in a cryptography mailing list/forum, read thw whitepaper, see the first critics and how he graciously responded to their questions. [The Complete Satoshi](/https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/)

A compilation of literature that supports the idea of bitcoin from a cryptography and freedome point of view [click here](/https://nakamotoinstitute.org/literature/)

A compilation of articles that were written from 2012. They are highly vetted and new articles go through rigorous brainstorming before they are allowed here. [click here](/https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool)

>It took me almost two months to go through all of this section, and by the time I finished I realized that the idea of bitcoin resonated with my inner self, and that it would make the life of every person better when it replaces our current monetary system. I got a strong conviction to leave my telecoms career and focus my efforts on building the bitcoin infrastrucuture and educating the people around me. 

### History of bitcoin

Bitcoin did not just come from nowhere. See the motivations behind it and the efforts that were done from the 1970s till its inception.
