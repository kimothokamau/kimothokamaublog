This is a step-by-step guide on how to open a localbitcoins account. It enables you to buy or sell bitcoins, and access to a bitcoin wallet that can send and receive bitcoins.

### Some background

- For readers in East Africa, this is like your _M-Pesa agent, MTN, wakala_ who trades cash to mobile money and vice versa, only that in this case it is where you trade bitcoin to mobile money and vice versa.
- Signing up requires an email, full name as in your identification card, and a phone number. To trade more than $1200 a year, more verification details are required.
- If you do not want to do a lot of KYC and want to trade larger volumes, head over to localcryptos.com. I only recommend this option to experienced bitcoin users who are already familiar with bitcoin wallets and how transactions that rely on escrow work.
- Localbitcoins is a peer-to-peer exchange, meaning that there is many independent buyers and sellers who set their trading terms,rates, payment methods etc). You are not buying bitcoins from a company. 
- Localbitcoins only exists to provide an [escrow](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-escrow-315826) platform. 
> Escrow is a financial arrangement in which two parties enlist a “third party” (who is neither the buyer nor the seller) to temporarily hold money, paperwork, or other assets for a transaction on their behalf before the transaction has been finalized.

>That third party, known as an escrow provider, helps make the transaction safer by protecting the assets of the buyer and seller until both parties have met their obligations for the agreement. Ideally, the escrow provider is a neutral third party who isn't concerned with whether the buyer or seller comes out ahead.
