## Introduction

This is a step-by-step guide on how to open a [localbitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=11uzd) account. This account:
- It enables you to buy or sell bitcoins
- Access to a bitcoin wallet that can send and receive bitcoins

This guide assumes that:

- You have a valid email account that you can access when required

- You have a valid phone number that you can receive a verifcation code on.
> It is advisable to use dedicated email account for bitcoin/crypto transactions. So even if someone gets access to your main email account, the one you use for facebook, they cannot access your crypto accounts and steal your funds.

- I did this video that demos how to open an email account using protonmail. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vz6Hsut7cE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> 

### The role of localbitcoins

- For readers in East Africa, localbitcoins is like your _M-Pesa agent, MTN agent, wakala, or Agency banking_ who trades cash to mobile money and vice versa, only that in this case it is where you trade bitcoin to mobile money and vice versa.
- Signing up requires an email, full name as in your identification document, and a valid phone number. 
   + To trade more than $1200 a year, more verification details are required e.g physical address verification
- If you do not want to do a lot of KYC and want to trade larger volumes, head over to localcryptos.com or hodlhold.com. I only recommend this option to experienced bitcoin users who are already familiar with bitcoin wallets and how transactions that rely on escrow work.
- Localbitcoins is a peer-to-peer exchange, meaning that there is many independent buyers and sellers who set their trading terms,rates, payment methods etc). You are not buying bitcoins from a company. 
- Localbitcoins main fucntion is to provide you with an [escrow](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-escrow-315826) platform. 
> Escrow is a financial arrangement in which two parties enlist a “third party” (who is neither the buyer nor the seller) to temporarily hold money, paperwork, or other assets for a transaction on their behalf before the transaction has been finalized.

>That third party, known as an escrow provider, helps make the transaction safer by protecting the assets of the buyer and seller until both parties have met their obligations for the agreement. Ideally, the escrow provider is a neutral third party who isn't concerned with whether the buyer or seller comes out ahead.
